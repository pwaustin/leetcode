    Problem:
    Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

    Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range:
    [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer
    overflows.

    :type x: int
    :rtype: int

    Solution:
    Pop digits from the original number and push them onto the new number; handle cases where overflow can occur.
